Final Project for Data Structures Class

///// IMPORTANT /////
When cloning this repository to your local machine, make sure you modify 
the DBInfo class so that it can interface with your database. It's 
currently set up to interface with my own database on my machine.

This program allows for the viewing of Ticket objects pertaining to
computer repair in a table. These table entries can be selected to be
either deleted or viewed, and new Ticket objects can be added through
pressing the Add Ticket button on the Main Window of this program. These
Ticket objects are populated into a LinkedList of type Ticket from a
database defined in DBInfo upon program start.
